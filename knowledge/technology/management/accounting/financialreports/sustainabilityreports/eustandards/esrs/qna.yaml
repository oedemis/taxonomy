      ## 3.3 Double materiality
      - 37. Double  materiality has  two  dimensions,  namely: impact  materiality and financial materiality. Unless specified otherwise, the terms 'material' and 'materiality' are used throughout ESRS to refer to double materiality.
      - 38. Impact materiality and financial materiality assessments are inter-related and the interdependencies between these two dimensions shall be considered. In general, the starting point is the assessment of impacts, although there may also  be  material risks and opportunities that  are  not  related  to  the  undertaking's impacts .  A  sustainability  impact may be financially material from inception or become financially material, when it could reasonably be expected to affect the undertaking's financial position, financial performance, cash flows, its access to finance or cost of capital over  the  short-,  medium-  or  long-term.  Impacts  are  captured  by  the  impact  materiality  perspective  irrespective  of whether or not they are financially material.
      - 39. In identifying and assessing the impacts, risks and opportunities in the undertaking's value chain to determine their materiality ,  the  undertaking shall focus on areas where impacts, risks and opportunities are deemed likely to arise, based on the nature of the activities, business relationships, geographies or other factors concerned.
      - 40. The undertaking shall consider how it is affected by its dependencies on the availability of natural, human and social resources at appropriate prices and quality, irrespective of its potential impacts on those resources.
      - 41. An undertaking's principal impacts, risks and opportunities are understood to be the same as the material impacts, risks and  opportunities  identified under  the double  materiality principle and  therefore  reported  on  in  its sustainability statement.

    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          What are the two dimensions of double materiality?
        answer: |
          Double materiality has two dimensions: impact materiality and financial materiality. Unless specified otherwise, references to "material" or "materiality" in ESRS refer to this double materiality concept.
      - question: |
          How are impact materiality and financial materiality related?
        answer: |
          Impact materiality and financial materiality assessments are inter-related, and their interdependencies must be considered. Generally, assessment starts with impacts, though some material risks and opportunities may not relate to the undertaking's impacts. A sustainability impact may be financially material from inception or become so over time.
      - question: |
          How should an undertaking focus its materiality assessment?
        answer: |
          When assessing materiality in its value chain, the undertaking should focus on areas where impacts, risks, and opportunities are likely to arise based on activities, business relationships, and geographies. It should also consider its dependencies on natural, human, and social resources, regardless of its impacts on them
  
  - context: |
      ## 3.4 Impact materiality
      - 43. A sustainability matter is material from an impact perspective when it pertains to the undertaking's material actual or  potential,  positive  or  negative impacts on  people  or  the  environment  over  the  short-,  medium-  or  long-term. Impacts include those connected with the undertaking's own operations and upstream and downstream value chain, including  through  its  products  and  services,  as  well  as  through  its  business  relationships. Business  relationships include those in the undertaking's upstream and downstream value chain and are not limited to direct contractual relationships.
      - 44. In this context, impacts on people or the environment include impacts in relation to environmental, social and governance matters.
      - 45. The materiality assessment of a negative impact is informed by the due diligence process defined in the international instruments of the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises. For actual negative impacts, materiality is based on the severity of the impact, while for potential negative impacts it is based on the severity and likelihood of the impact. Severity is based on the following factors:
      - (a) the scale;
      - (b) scope; and
      - (c) irremediable character of the impact.
      - In  the  case  of  a  potential  negative  human  rights  impact,  the  severity  of  the  impact  takes  precedence  over  its likelihood.
      - 46. For positive impacts, materiality is based on:
      - (a) the scale and scope of the impact for actual impacts; and
      - (b) the scale, scope and likelihood of the impact for potential impacts.
    
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          What defines a sustainability matter as material from an impact perspective according to paragraph 43?
        answer: |
          A sustainability matter is material from an impact perspective when it relates to the undertaking's material actual or potential, positive or negative impacts on people or the environment over different time horizons. These impacts include those connected with the undertaking's operations and value chain, including through products, services, and business relationships across the upstream and downstream value chain.
      - question: |
          How is the materiality of negative impacts assessed?
        answer: |
          For negative impacts, materiality assessment follows due diligence processes defined in UN Guiding Principles and OECD Guidelines. For actual negative impacts, materiality is based on severity, while potential negative impacts are assessed on severity and likelihood. Severity is determined by scale, scope, and irremediable character. For potential human rights impacts, severity takes precedence over likelihood.
      - question: |
          What factors determine the materiality of positive impacts?
        answer: |
          For positive impacts, materiality is determined differently depending on whether the impact is actual or potential. Actual positive impacts are assessed based on scale and scope. Potential positive impacts are evaluated based on scale, scope, and likelihood of the impact occurring.

      ## 3.5 Financial materiality
      - 47. The scope of financial materiality for sustainability reporting is an expansion of the scope of materiality used in the process of determining which information should be included in the undertaking's financial statements.
      - 48. The financial materiality assessment corresponds to the identification of information that is considered material for primary users of general-purpose financial reports in making decisions relating to providing resources to the entity. In particular, information is considered material for  primary users of general-purpose financial reports if omitting, misstating or obscuring that information could reasonably be expected to influence decisions that they make on the basis of the undertaking's sustainability statement.
      - 49. A sustainability matter is material from a financial perspective if it triggers or could reasonably be expected to trigger material financial  effects on  the  undertaking.  This  is  the  case  when  a  sustainability  matter  generates risks or opportunities that  have a  material influence, or could reasonably be expected to have a material influence, on the undertaking's development, financial position, financial performance, cash flows, access to finance or cost of capital over the short-, medium- or long-term. Risks and opportunities may derive from past events or future events. The financial  materiality of  a  sustainability  matter  is  not  constrained  to  matters  that  are  within  the  control  of  the undertaking  but  includes  information  on  material risks and opportunities attributable  to business  relationships beyond the scope of consolidation used in the preparation of financial statements.
      - 50. Dependencies on  natural, human and social  resources can be sources of financial risks or opportunities . Dependencies may trigger effects in two possible ways:
      - (a) they may influence  the  undertaking's  ability  to  continue  to  use  or  obtain  the  resources  needed  in  its  business processes, as well as the quality and pricing of those resources; and
      - (b) they may affect the undertaking's ability to rely on relationships needed in its business processes on acceptable terms.
      - 51. The materiality of risks and opportunities is  assessed based on a combination of the likelihood of occurrence and the potential magnitude of the financial effects.
    
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          How does financial materiality for sustainability reporting relate to financial statements materiality?
        answer: |
          Financial materiality for sustainability reporting expands the scope of materiality used for financial statements. It identifies information considered material for primary users of financial reports in making resource allocation decisions about the entity.
      - question: |
          When is a sustainability matter considered material from a financial perspective?
        answer: |
          A sustainability matter is financially material if it triggers or could reasonably trigger material financial effects on the undertaking by generating risks or opportunities that materially influence development, financial position, performance, cash flows, or capital costs over various time horizons.
      - question: |
          How do dependencies on resources relate to financial materiality?
        answer: |
          Dependencies on natural, human, and social resources can be sources of financial risks or opportunities in two ways: by influencing the undertaking's ability to use or obtain necessary resources (including quality and pricing), and by affecting the undertaking's ability to maintain necessary business relationships on acceptable terms.
